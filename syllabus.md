<strong>Course Overview</strong>

In this course, we will explore the history of the modern United States through the lens of popular culture. We will analyze film, music, television, comics, and more, to seek to understand American values, anxieties, and politics from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Rather than approaching popular culture as a collection of distractions or diversions from “real” history, we will consider artifacts of popular culture with critical analysis in order to place them in their historical, cultural, and critical contexts. To do so we will return to questions about a few central themes throughout the semester:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li><u>Moral panics</u>: Why have certain works served as lightning rods in American society? What do these moral panics reveal about popular culture? What do they reveal about American politics and society more broadly?</li>
 	<li><u>Inclusion vs. exclusion</u>: To what extent has popular culture unified Americans from different background? To what extent has it played into exclusionary lines between different groups within the United States?</li>
 	<li><u>Capital and consumption</u>: How has the business of popular culture changed from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century to the present? Who have been the dominant consumers of popular culture in different time periods? How have technological innovations affected the ways in which Americans consume popular culture?</li>
 	<li><u>Production and representation</u>: Who have been the creators of popular culture, historically speaking? Who has been represented within works of pop culture? How has this changed over time, and how are the concepts of production and representation related?</li>
</ul>
</li>

 	<li>To learn how to “read” different historical “texts.” That is, in this course we will be analyzing many types of sources related to popular culture.

 	<li>To understand the history of the United States through the lens of popular culture.</li>
 	<li>To hone students’ abilities to critique and contextualize artifacts of popular culture.</li>

<strong>Course Materials</strong>

<strong>You will not need to purchase any textbooks for this course.</strong> All readings will be posted on the course Sakai page. Every Friday afternoon, I will post the required readings for the following week.

<strong>Occasionally, you will be expected to obtain a copy of various films or television episodes</strong>. I will always note the best (and cheapest) ways to acquire these. Usually, a digital rental via Amazon (or a similar service) will suffice. I will provide more details about these within the first few weeks of class.

This course assumes some basic knowledge of late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States history. If you feel like you need some supplementary historical context in order to fully understand the course material, I recommend reading <em><a href="http://americanyawp.com">The American Yawp</a> </em>or purchasing a textbook for the history of the United States since 1865 (or 1877), such as <em>American Horizons</em>.

<strong>Assignments</strong>

<em>Blog posts and responses</em> (20% of your grade): See the <a href="https://hist363.web.unc.edu/hist-363-blogs/"><strong>HIST 363 Blog Posts page</strong></a> for instructions for this assignment.

<em>Midterm essay</em> (15% of your grade): Rather than taking a traditional blue-book midterm exam, you will be required to write a 1250- to 1500- word argumentative essay in response to a question posed by Prof. Wright, based on course material in Units 1 and 2.

<em>Final project</em> (20% of your grade): Visit <a href="https://hist363.web.unc.edu/assignments/final-project/"><strong>this page</strong></a> for more information about your final project, which will require you to formulate and articulate an argument about one topic related to our course in a 6-8 page essay, 12-15 minute documentary, website or online exhibit, or another medium (subject to Prof. Wright's approval).

<em>Final Project Checkpoint Assignments </em>(5% of your grade): Throughout the semester, you will complete various "checkpoint" assignments. Visit <a href="https://hist363.web.unc.edu/assignments/final-project/"><strong>the Final Project page</strong></a> for more details on these assignments and their deadlines. These assignments will provide opportunities for me to provide feedback on your project as you develop it. It will also allow you to get a head start on the intellectual work of your project.

<em>Pop Culture Log Assignment</em> (10% of your grade): Throughout the semester, you will be expected to maintain a “pop culture log”—that is, a concise record of your own daily engagement with popular culture outside of class from January to April. How you assemble your log—in a physical notebook, an Excel spreadsheet, a note-taking app in your phone—is up to you, but you will have to print a copy for multiple “check-points” and reflection essays throughout the semester. We will discuss this assignment during the second week of class.

<em>Self-assessments</em> (10% of your grade): Periodically throughout the semester, you will complete self-assessments of your work in HIST 363. These will allow you to reflect upon and "grade" your performance in the class, consider what you have learned, and brainstorm what you would like to learn as the class moves forward. You should take these assessments as seriously as you would any traditional assignment, as they will aid you in gaining and retaining knowledge beyond learning facts for an upcoming exam. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There are no opportunities to make up a Self Assessment if you miss class without a) an excused absence, and b) notifying me before class.</strong></span>

<em>Final exam</em> (10% of your grade): You will take only one formal exam for HIST 363, the final exam, on Monday, April 27, at 8:00am. The nature and format of this exam will be discussed later in the semester, so that you have plenty of time to prepare for it.

<em>Attendance and participation </em>(10% of your grade): You should always come to class having completed any assignments for that day. All students are expected to be prepared and active participants in class discussions.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Late</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Policy</span>: </strong>Late blog posts and comments will receive no credit. Students who do not attend class on Self Assessment days without contacting Prof. Wright ahead of time with a justifiable excuse will receive no credit for Self Assessments. For Pop Culture Logs and the Midterm Essay, 1/3 of a letter grade will be docked from the assignment for every 24 hours it is late, beginning at the deadline. E.g., a Pop Culture Log submitted between 5:01am the day it was due and 4:59am the following day will lose 1/3 of a letter grade.
